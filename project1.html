                    Flann O'brien's novel <i>The Third Policeman</i>, published in 1939, is a dark comic novel
                    exploring the nature of death, time, and existance. It is very impactful piece of Irish Literature
                    is very well-known throughout the world. In this project, I worked with a team of students
                    interested in Computer Science, English, and Film to recreate scenes from the novel in Augmented
                    Reality. By Using the Swift programming language, optimizing the ARKit framework, creating
                    3D models using Cinema 4D, and animating them using Reality Composer. This project will be
                    presented at the International Flann O'Brien Conference in April, 2022.
